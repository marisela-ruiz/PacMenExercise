# PacMenExercise

# What Is It?
A coding project to highlight the use of arrays and techniques for manipulating the DOM. This web page holds a button to start the game and another button to create a PacMan. <br> *See screenshot below*

# How to Run
Copy and paste marisela-ruiz.github.io/PacMenExercise/ into your browser and begin the fun! Alternatively, you can download all files from this repository. Be sure to store all files in the same directory/folder. Load the index.html file and create your PacMen! 

# Future Improvements
A fun improvement would be to reverse the PacMan image when in the reverse direction.
